# Password-Generator

basic form -
pick how long the password is and generate random upper case letters to that length
now print into textbox

what I have right now-
when I click the generate buttom it gives me a random uppercase letter

who do I make is so its based off the length I ask for

we need a return

we did it. Now I can generate a password with just upper case letters.

Now do that with more than just upper case letters

next basic step-
just have it so it take all the four different randoms, no need to be picky yet
